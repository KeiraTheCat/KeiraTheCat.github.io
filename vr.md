### VR Rhythm game experiment
Unfinished experiment into making a VR rhythm game. This was my first time experimenting with developing for VR. This project attempted to be a mix of the gameplay of the VR rhythm game "Beat Saber" and the popular Japanese rhythm game "Sound Voltex"
* Dynamically populate user interfaces via each songs matching json files
* Read and play songs from prepared json file data
* Synchronise gameplay to music via UE4's TimeSynth module
* Dyamically affect music via motion controllers
* Capable of converting maps from other popular VR Rhythm games
